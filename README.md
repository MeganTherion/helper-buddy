## HelperBuddy

HelperBuddy is a task management system designed to help users manage everyday life.
HelperBuddy is marketed towards users identifying as neurodivergent -- it breaks down everyday tasks into smaller, clear, and more manageable pieces, providing positive and encouraging feedback for tasks fully or partially completed.

## Why HelperBuddy?

For many, tasks like cleaning the bathroom, doing the laundry, or washing up the dishes are simple, everyday jobs that can be completed without much thought. However, ADHD, depression and anxiety, and other neurodivergent struggles can make balancing and managing these essential everyday tasks an overwhelming source of stress and anxiety. For those struggling this way, failing to take care of these everyday tasks often results in debilitating feelings of shame and increased avoidance as these unaddressed tasks pile up. 
With this in mind, the members of our group decided to help ourselves and others by building HelperBuddy. Our app breaks down these tasks into simple, visual, and motivating steps for the user to interact with. 

## Project Setup

The following steps are only for _one_ of the group members to perform.

1. Create your own copy of this repo using the `Use This Template` button, ideally using the name of your project. The repo should be marked Public
2. Verify that the skeleton code now shows up in your repo on GitHub, you should be automatically redirected
3. Clone your copy of the repo to your dev machine
4. Add your team members as collaborators to the project so that they can push to this repo
5. Let your team members know the repo URL so that they use the same repo (they should _not_ create a copy/fork of this repo since that will add additional workflow complexity to the project)


## Getting Started

7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`
